# Tech-Roadmap
This is the set of technologies I personally used so far in my self-learning career using Obsidian to link my mindmap to the technologies I'm learning along the way.

For example if I learn about CSS, I've discovered there's a rabbit hole where I learn about Grid, Flexbox, "compiled" CSS (Sass). 

Another example is when I learn about MVC I would like to see how the ORM (the model) plays with the HTML (views) and the interaction between the backend language and the Javascript frameworks (controller).

This set of notes is represented by an Obsidian graph.
