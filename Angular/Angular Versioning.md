# Angular Versioning

Angular more or less gets updated every six months - Angular 1 wasn't future proof and got a rewrite on Version 2. 3 got skipped almost like a deformed [Zelda] timeline to what we have now (13+)

1 -> 2 -> 4 -> ... 13

The vast difference comes between versions 1 and 2 and largely [backwards compatible] with minor changes every incremental 6 month change.
