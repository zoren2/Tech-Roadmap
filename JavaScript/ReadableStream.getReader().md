# ReadableStream.getReader()

The `getReader()` method of the [ReadableStream] interface creates a reader and locks the stream to it. With the stream locked, no other reader can be acquired until this one is released.

```javascript
function fetchStream() {
  const reader = stream.getReader();
  let charsReceived = 0;

  // read() returns a promise that resolves
  // when a value has been received
  reader.read().then(
  	function processText({ done, value }) {
    // Result objects contain two properties:
    // done  - true if the stream has already given you all its data.
    // value - some data. Always undefined when done is true.
    if (done) {
      console.log("Stream complete");
      para.textContent = value;
      return;
    }

    // value for fetch streams is a Uint8Array
    charsReceived += value.length;
    const chunk = value;
    let listItem = document.createElement('li');
    listItem.textContent = 'Received ' + charsReceived + ' characters so far. Current chunk = ' + chunk;
    list2.appendChild(listItem);

    result += chunk;

    // Read some more, and call this function again
    return reader.read().then(processText);
  });
}
```
