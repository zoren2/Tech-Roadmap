# section

The [[section]] [[html]] tag means that the content inside is grouped. This means that it relates to a single theme and appears as an entry in an outline of the page.

Comparatively to [[div]], it does not convey any meaning aside from any found in its [[class]], [[lang]], and [[title]] attributes.
