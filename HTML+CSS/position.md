# position
The `position` property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

- [static], default and not affected by top, bottom, left, and right properties.
- [relative], positioned relative to its normal position
- [fixed], positioned relative to the viewport
- [absolute], positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (compared to viewport like with fixed)
- [sticky], positioned relative to users scroll position. Toggles between relative and fixed depending on scroll position (think menu that sticks only when you're at the top)
